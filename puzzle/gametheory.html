    <p class="flavor">Hi! I am John, your gamemaster for today. Welcome to Nashville&apos;s Equilibrium Escape Games! As you feel your way around our dark rooms, remember to look for hidden clues if you get stuck! Good luck!</p>
<p>Dr. Evil&apos;s Laboratory of Ivermectin Production<br>
  Grim&apos;s Boneyard<br>
  Pyramids of our Ancestors<br>
  Secrets of the Network Room<br>
  Smooth Re-entry to the Ghost Ship<br></p>
<hr><p><ul><li>A hole in the pyramid&apos;s floor opens, revealing three tall ladders. You climb down from height and enter the lobby!</li><li>Amongst the gemstones, you find a peculiar staff in the shape of a cobra. A throne with a pharaoh sitting on it to the southwest catches your eye.</li><li>As you enter the pyramid, you see that tendrils are creeping all over the walls. A pile of gemstones towards the east catches your eye.</li><li>Before you get a chance to read the note, the same feminine voice whispers: “You&apos;re dead meat…” You ignore it and read the note. One of the colours asks you to look behind a painting towards the east.</li><li>Behind the supercomputer, you find a drone and a remote. You fly the drone through a small window to a previously inaccessible part of the room, towards the southwest.</li><li>Each of the ten empty test tubes has a number written on it. To the southeast of the room, you see a closet requiring a passcode to open. You head towards it.</li><li>Entering the ten-digit passcode, the closet swings open and you find several bottles of ivermectin pills, as well as a UV torch. With nothing else of interest, you explore towards the south.</li><li>Flipping the piece of artwork over, you find a pair of headphones and put them on. The voice tells you to examine the chest towards the southwest.</li><li>Inside the coffin, you find a worn-out tennis racket and two balls. The south wall looks hollow. You hit a ball against the wall and a hidden door swings open to reveal a secret chamber! You enter towards the south.</li><li>Next to the periodic table, there are two keys hanging from a thin string. Removing the keys, you wonder how the string was able to support their weight. You head towards the north, where the door to the lab is located.</li><li>On the captain&apos;s desk, you find a note written in two different colours. As the lighting is poor, you move to the southwest to examine the note in detail.</li><li>One of the routers has seven lights blinking at strange intervals. Counting the number of blinks, you figure out that it is a message telling you to turn off the fan! You walk towards the northwest, where the switch is.</li><li>Reaching the southernmost wall, you use the bone to hit a dented portion three times. A passageway opens, and you enter the lobby!</li><li>Tendrils creep all over the walls of this secret chamber. Among them, you find a tightly wrapped bone, which you decide to take along as you explore southwards.</li><li>The chest requires a passcode to open. You read the second of the two colours on the note, which gives you the six-digit passcode required to unlock the chest. You find a miniature of a ship in the chest, which you bring to the east side of the room.</li><li>The height of the number pad is so low that you need to squat down. Entering the passcode, the door opens, and you enter the lobby. You have escaped the network room.</li><li>There is an empty cork board onto which you shine the UV torch – a message appears, even when you did not expect it to. “Near the periodic table lies your next clue,” it reads. You move towards the periodic table on the west wall.</li><li>You awaken alone in a dusty boneyard. Brushing off the dust from your pants, you decide to explore towards the north, where you see some dangling objects.</li><li>You awaken in a desert and look about. Wow, there is a pyramid taller than you! Two sphinxes glare at you from the northeast, so you walk over to have a look.</li><li>You awaken in a lab, with a rotten, half-eaten banana lying on the desk. Several lab racks with test tubes to the west catch your eye.</li><li>You awaken in a network room, with two tall racks of hardware located to the north. You proceed in that direction to have a closer look.</li><li>You awaken to a ghostly feminine voice. “You&apos;re doomed to sail the seven seas forever…” You explore the captain&apos;s desk to the east.</li><li>You find an empty bottle etched on the wall and put the miniature ship inside. A stone door creaks open as a result, and you enter the lobby. You are done!</li><li>You find two skeleton keys hanging from height, and you barely manage to reach them. You decide to explore further towards the north.</li><li>You insert the two keys into the laboratory door and it opens without much resistance, sending you into the lobby. You are done!</li><li>You notice that the four fingers on each hand of the pharaoh are slightly curled, and you put the staff into its grasp. Immediately, a rumbling sound comes from the southeast of the room.</li><li>You notice there are letters on the eight fan blades when switched off. The message says “well done! Now look behind the supercomputer.” You move eastwards to the only supercomputer in the room.</li><li>You reach a coffin, which lies evenly across a rotting plank. Upon inserting the two keys, it unlocks. You carry the coffin to the west of the room, where a light source allows you to examine it more clearly.</li><li>You try pushing a sphinx&apos;s head and it turns – even when it looks rigid and creaky. A stone door at the side of the pyramid opens, and you head to the northwest to check it out.</li><li>You use the drone to press a button on the wall. A four-digit number is projected onto the wall. You realise there is a door towards the south that requires a numerical passcode to open, and proceed there.</li></ul>

<p class="hints">Hints</p>
<details><summary>There are some directions in these rooms, how are they relevant?</summary>
The directions you would walk in the rooms should trace out a specific grid in each room that you can later apply an extraction on, clued by "feel your way around our dark rooms" in the flavortext
</details><details><summary>Not sure what is important in all these details?</summary>
You need to find 2 numbers per line of text (some hidden)
</details><details><summary>Not sure what to do with these details from the escape rooms?</summary>
The key words in the flavortext for the next step are "John" "Nash"ville and "Equilibrium", which is a concept related to game theory.
