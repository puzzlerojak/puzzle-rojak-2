    <div class="puzzle-erratum">[Sunday, May 25 at 04:40 AM UTC] Erratum in <a href="jenga.html"><b>Jenga</b></a>: <span style="background-color: #FF0000">The line for Row 33 was changed.</span></div>
<p>
Rules:<br>
Each piece is labeled with a single letter.<br>
Words are read vertically from top to bottom, and whenever a word is formed, there are no other letters in that column.<br>
Words are formed after the complete row of 3 pieces have been placed.<br>
Each new row is formed by pieces starting from different rows from each other.<br>
Each new row is also formed by pieces starting from different columns from each other.<br>
No piece was replaced onto its same column in a given turn.<br>
Normal Jenga rules apply:<br>
There are 54 total pieces<br>
Each row is formed by taking 3 pieces from any row of the tower except the row just beneath the new row<br>
Each new row must be fully filled with 3 pieces before building the next row above it<br></p>
<p>Row 18 (Pre-start): It looks like ORIENTING has already been formed. <br>
Row 19: Letâ€™s begin! I take an L from row 6 and a R from row 16. REPRODUCED is formed.<br>
Row 20: I take a piece from row 10 and a piece from row 14. <br>
Row 21: I take a piece from row 2 and a piece from row 13.<br>
Row 22: I take an A from row 3 and a piece from row 18.<br>
Row 23: I take a piece from row 11.<br>
Row 24: I take an S from row 6.<br>
Row 25: I take an S from row 4. SECEDED and SPILLED are formed.<br>
Row 26: I take an A from row 1 and a R from row 23. REASONING is formed.<br>
Row 27: I take a D from row 3 and a piece from row 17. DUTIFULLY is formed.<br>
Row 28: I take a W from row 22. CREDITOR is formed.<br>
Row 29: I take a piece from row 4 and a piece from row 9.<br>
Row 31: I take a piece from row 22.<br>
Row 32: I take a D from row 1 and an I from row 20. <br>
Row 33: I take a W from row 28. I also take a D from row 29. PROCEEDED and DUTIFULLY are formed.<br>
Row 34: I take a R from row 2. By completing this row, reading off the 6 columns from left to right, I can read off the words WORLDWIDE, PROCEEDED, DUTIFULLY, DISCREDIT, REASONING, and INSTALLED.<br>
Row 35: Oh no! Unless I take a block from Row 33, I have no choice but to cause the tower to collapse! (Tries to take a block) Crash! I lost the game! Could you help us figure out what happened?<br></p>

<p class="hints"><a onClick='document.getElementById("text").style.display="initial";' class="ticket-button">Click to show hints</a></p>
<span style="display:none;" id="text"><details><summary>Can you give me some tips on how to solve this logic puzzle?</summary>
From the top, figure out where the letters that leave rows 30-32 go to leave them blank.<br>
From the bottom, track carefully where each piece goes, specifically the second column should be very strong given that new rows are formed by pieces from separate columns. Be mindful that in each column where a word is formed, no other letters exist in that column, so at some point those pieces had to have been removed.</details>
<details><summary>I have solved the Jenga part, how do I extract the answer?</summary>
Read the top rows of the starting Jenga tower. You should get a 6 letter answer!
