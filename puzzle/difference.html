    <p class="flavor">Something seems off about these sentences, although the exact number of times it is off doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Baby, who is a world class getaway driver who ees every detail in front of him when he's in a car, only notices Buddy when we notice him. (4)<br>
  Bond looks at his cards, which in itself can be a tell...and o that the audience knows what Bond is playing with. (6)<br>
  The plethora of dragon types e don't see outside the book is a great example of how much thought and care as put into this film. (13)<br>
  Cobb is basically the ame age but Aito is uper old even though they both entered limbo about the ame time. (6)<br>
  O do all of the creatures in this universe have low resolution memories, or is it just Hifu and Po? (2)<br>
  Most of you identified the frame correctly btw, and it's one of the fun things that De Palma does that you may have never really cognizantly noticed. He used first person camera shots quite a few times. It orks to disguise hosever eyes e're looking through and it inflates the suspense. (15)<br>
  Love the juxtaposition of Ade's meek lack of confidence against his self assured avatar, Parzival. (2)<br>
  Toomes has been elling this alien tech for the past eight years and this is the first time Pidey or anyone else has een any of it? (14)<br>
  We find out later these two are part of the other team watching Ethan's team in Prague, but they are terrible at their job! I mean, what kind of training did you get to be a py in the CIA? (2)<br>
  If all trolls do is teal ocks, why are we o afraid of them that we name our children tupid hit like Hiccup just to avoid them? (10)<br>
  Watching this race, I guess thank god that nobody other than a elect group of believers till try to do this. Can you imagine ticking another thousand or o people in this thing? (2)<br>
  In an age of cinematic universes here the slightest continuity errors between different films ith different casts and different filmmakers can get you lynched, this Chitauri Leviathan's final location is pretty close to here Hulk and Thor landed on it in Avengers. (7)<br>
  Then Edgar slyly introduces the main love interest, Debora, marching along to "Harlem Shuffle" in her yellow skirt and e see Baby's heart turn from black to red. (2)<br>
  For some it as hen he played Picard's clone, for other it as his pure insanity in Bronson, for me and a lot of other fans, this as the exact moment that Tom Hardy broke into our hearts to stay forever (1) <br>
  Onder if Oogway designed this turtle shell looking restraint? (9)<br>
  So is this a hint the Bond as a tad more monogamous prior to Vesper ripping his guts out? Hmph. (3)</p>
