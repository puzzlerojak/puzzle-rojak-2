    <p>With the help of the answers we already have and the <a href="https://www.conceptispuzzles.com/index.aspx?uri=puzzle/skyscrapers/techniques" target="_blank">skyscraper</a> grids, we note that each skyscraper grid has 6 sets of 6 ?s, and there are 6 answers. This suggests we can associate each answer with 6 numbers from 1-6 somehow. Given the answers teams have, one thing to try would simply be to convert the letters to numbers A1Z26. We note that each string we already have has 6 digits in them, which fits the skyscrapers.<br></p>
<p>Now we can start associating answers to skyscrapers. The easiest break in comes from ABBEY, because of the direction of the given arrows and the 1 in ABBEY, it can only fit at the bottom of grid 1. VOW becomes the only word that can pair at the top of grid 1 with ABBEY. Of the remaining 4 words, CUBED is the only word that can belong to the top of Grid 3, and then it has only one match in BLEW. For grid 2, the 2 words are fixed because of the 4 given at the bottom of C2 (otherwise 6 has to be in R3C2 which contradicts the 5 in R3), so COVE belongs at the top and WELD on the left. We can then solve each of the 3 skyscrapers.<br><img style="height: 150px;" src="../static/puzzle_resources/altius/sol234543.png" alt="Altius image 2"><br><br>
Extracting and ordering as given gives the meta answer PEAKCCOLO. <br></p>
<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>In this meta, teams could backsolve the puzzles in the meta without having solved the meta. I had a list of 2 3-letter words, 13 4-letter words, and 15 5-letter words to choose from, and many were pretty close to each other. The constraints include the fact that the answers can only contain the letters ABCDEFKLMNOPUVWXYZ, with a 1 occuring exactly once (so exactly one of AKLMNOPU appears in the answer). Given 2 answers per grid, a lot of the words with many 5s and 6s could not fit either. It was a pretty fun and cool process constructing this meta!</p>
