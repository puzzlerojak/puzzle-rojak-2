    <p>This puzzle is about literal chinese translations. Solvers might get the aha in several ways: the easiest is probably by directly googling any of the phrases “add oil”, “five flower meat” or “beautiful country”. The title suggests a chinese theme to the puzzle and the flavor text hints at literal translations - “thing” in chinese is 东西, the title of the puzzle, which literally translates to “East West”.<br></p>
<p>Several of the clues are direct. The enumerations might look strange, until solvers realize that they represent the number of letters in the Hanyu Pinyin romanizations of each of the answers (in chinese). There are 24 clues in total, which correspond to 24 sets of given words/short phrases. This suggests that we should have a one-to-one mapping between a clue and a set of words. Solvers might also come to the realization that each word/short phrase in the given sets is literally translated from english to chinese and put together in the given order to form an answer to one of the clues in chinese.<br></p>
<p>For example:<br>
Add - Oil: “Add” translates to 加, and “Oil” translates to 油, and 加油 (pinyin: jia you) is the answer to the clue “A form of encouragement - come on!” - “jia you” matches the 3 3 enumeration given. We extract the third letter - A.<br>
Bear - Cat: “Bear” translates to 熊, and “Cat” translates to 猫, and 熊猫 (pinyin: xiong mao) is the answer to the direct clue “Panda” - “xiong mao” matches the 5 3 enumeration given. We extract the first letter - X.<br>
Note that the clues are given in alphabetical order, so the ordering we should use is the order in which the sets of words/short phrases are presented.<br>
The answers to the clues in order of the given sets of words from top to bottom are as follows:<br></p>

<p>Solvers might notice that several words are missing from the given sets of words. Namely, there are twelve missing words, corresponding to the twelve chinese zodiac animals - all of which are bolded above.<br></p>
<p>The clue phrase tells us to “map to letters in flavor text” - there are 24 letters in the flavor text, exactly the same as the number of clues/answers! The last step is to extract letters from the flavor text corresponding to the answers with missing animals, and re-order those extracted letters in the order the animals appear in the chinese zodiac. This gives us ANS IS TIGHTLY, so we submit TIGHTLY.<br></p>
<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>Being ethnically chinese, I’ve wanted to write a puzzle involving literal chinese translations for a while, given how scarcely the language is featured in puzzle hunts as compared to other languages which share more common features with english.<br></p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the majority of our target audience do not know chinese, I deliberately made as many of the clues as direct as I could. I also tried to make sure most of the proverbs can be found by a Google search query along the lines of “ruin the final product by appending superfluous features chinese idiom”, for example.<br></p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the restrictions on the letters I needed in some of these answers, and the restriction that each zodiac animal appears exactly once and in separate answers, a few of the answers ended up being too obscure for my liking. In light of this, I tried to make sure that solvers didn’t need all the answers to solve this puzzle. There exist many chinese proverbs that contain two or more zodiac animals which have interesting literal translations in their own right (horse-horse-tiger-tiger, for example), but due to the extraction method used in this puzzle I was unable to include some of those.<br></p>
<p>I hope that it wasn’t too frustrating for non-chinese speakers!<br></p>
