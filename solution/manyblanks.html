    <p>This puzzle presents a lot of blanks, and not much to work on. However, there are 2 key pieces of information in each minipuzzle that should help identify each series, the first is the punctuation, spacing and numbers present in the titles, and the second is the number of lines in each series, which have been given explicitly. Once a couple of the series have been identified and/or the puzzle title should clue that we are looking specifically for detective/mystery book series, which should help narrow down the search space further. The full titles are:<br><p>

1st to Die<br>
2nd Chance<br>
3rd Degree<br>

We can now find a 6th book series, with book titles that takes the form “The Case of the xx xx”. This series is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Mason_bibliography" target="_blank">Perry Mason detective book series</a>, and each minipuzzle answer is a synonym of one of his books:<br>
The Case of the Dangerous Dowager<br>
The Case of the Crooked Candle<br>
The Case of the Perjured Parrot<br>
The Case of the Angry Mourner<br>
The Case of the Spurious Spinster<br>
We can index into these titles by the indices given to get the final answer: <b>JUDICIAL</b>, an apt description of this series!<br></p><br></p>
<h2>Author's Notes</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this puzzle were the many other hunt puzzles using Agatha Christie mystery series. I found it strange that the Perry Mason series has not featured as all in any hunt puzzle I have tried, especially since it is supposedly the third best selling book series.<br></p>
<p>My original idea was minipuzzles that were other popular book series with words repeated in all the books removed. Celestine suggested limiting it to only mystery/detective series, and using the punctuation in titles and number of books to help clue the series.<br></p>
<p>The Sue Grafton series not having a word for X and not having a Z book prevented me from using it in the I know my ABCs puzzle, so I was glad to be able to use it here.<br></p>
